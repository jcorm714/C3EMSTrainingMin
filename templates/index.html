                            "C3 EMS Training on-line testing model has been terrific for our membership. As a
                            small
                            non-profit ambulance service, we are always looking for opportunities to control
                            costs. This
                            testing service gave us the option of purchasing a specific window in which our
                            users could
                            gain access and complete their annual safety training. We purchased 8 week of
                            access, and
                            found that most of our users were able to navigate the login with ease. They
                            followed
                            instructions and completed the requirements. Mrs. Cormier Cleaveland provided us
                            with timely
                            reports, which allowed officers to connect with those who were running out of time
                            to access
                            the system. We ended up with 99% compliance, and have already indicated that we are
                            interested in renewing our membership for next year's annual training/testing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Automating the testing process has allowed us to create a standardized approach to
                            training and
                            testing our members. We can maintain a permanent record of who tested, and how they
                            performed.
                            The online system allows for self-remediation and testing, which is fantastic. We
                            are very
